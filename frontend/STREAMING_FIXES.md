# StreamGuard Video Streaming Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Manifest URL Recognition Issue**
- **Problem**: Real manifest IDs starting with "manifest_" were being treated as demo content and returning empty URLs
- **Root Cause**: The `getManifestUrl` function in StreamPage.tsx was filtering out all manifest IDs that started with "manifest_"
- **Fix**: Updated logic to only treat "demo_" prefixed IDs as demo content, while allowing real "manifest_" IDs to use Walrus URLs
- **Files Changed**: `pages/StreamPage.tsx`

### 2. **Video.js Double Initialization**
- **Problem**: Video.js player was being initialized multiple times causing warnings and potential conflicts
- **Root Cause**: React's development mode strict effects and component re-renders
- **Fix**: 
  - Added check to prevent double initialization
  - Improved cleanup logic with try-catch for safer disposal
  - Enhanced source updating for existing players instead of re-initializing
- **Files Changed**: `components/video/StreamPlayer.tsx`

### 3. **Error Handling and User Experience**
- **Problem**: React errors were not being handled gracefully
- **Root Cause**: No error boundaries in place to catch video player errors
- **Fix**:
  - Created `ErrorBoundary` component following React best practices
  - Wrapped StreamPlayer with ErrorBoundary for graceful error handling
  - Enhanced error messages to distinguish between network errors and other issues
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (new)
  - `pages/StreamPage.tsx`

### 4. **Walrus URL Consistency**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent URL formats between manifest and thumbnail requests
- **Fix**: Standardized Walrus URL format to `https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space/v1/{blobId}`
- **Files Changed**: `utils/thumbnails.ts`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Manifest URL Handling
```typescript
// Before - treated all "manifest_" IDs as demo
if (stream.hlsManifestWalrusId.startsWith('demo_') || stream.hlsManifestWalrusId.startsWith('manifest_')) {
  return '';
}

// After - only demo IDs are filtered out
if (stream.hlsManifestWalrusId.startsWith('demo_')) {
  return '';
}
// All other IDs (including "manifest_") get proper Walrus URLs
```

### Video.js Player Management
```typescript
// Before - Always created new player
const player = videojs(videoRef.current, config);

// After - Check for existing player first
if (playerRef.current) {
  // Update source instead of re-initializing
  playerRef.current.src({ src: manifestUrl, type: 'application/x-mpegURL' });
  return;
}
// Only create new player if none exists
```

### Error Boundary Implementation
- Class-based component following React error boundary pattern
- Implements `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch`
- Provides user-friendly fallback UI with retry options
- Shows error details in development mode for debugging

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Real Streams**: Manifest URLs starting with "manifest_" will attempt to load from Walrus
2. **Demo Streams**: Only manifest IDs starting with "demo_" will show placeholder content
3. **Error Handling**: Video player errors are caught gracefully with user-friendly messages
4. **Network Errors**: When Walrus content is not available, users get informative error messages
5. **Player Stability**: No more double initialization warnings from Video.js

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Real Stream Playback**: Create a stream and verify the manifest URL is constructed correctly
2. **Test Error Recovery**: Disconnect internet and verify error boundary works
3. **Test Demo Content**: Navigate to demo streams and verify they show appropriate placeholders
4. **Test Player Stability**: Switch between streams rapidly to verify no initialization conflicts

## Production Considerations

- **Walrus Availability**: Monitor Walrus testnet uptime and implement fallback strategies
- **Error Reporting**: Consider integrating error boundary with external error tracking service
- **CDN Integration**: For production, consider CDN caching for Walrus content
- **Quality Selection**: Future enhancement to support multiple quality levels from Walrus
